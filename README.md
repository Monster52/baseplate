# Baseplate

Baseplate is my attempt as creating a simple and light CSS gem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'baseplate'
```

Add this line to application.css

```ruby
 *= require baseplate
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install baseplate

## Usage

TODO: Fix this section
ADD: navbar and nav items, buttons, forms and inputs, and links

## Contributing
